  <title>Rebooting the System</title>

  <para>If you built your final system using the boot method, just run
  <command>shutdown -r now</command> to reboot again, using your newly-built
  kernel instead of the miminal one currently in use. If you chrooted,
  there are a few more steps.</para>

  <para>The system you have created in this book is quite minimal, and most
  likely will not have the functionality you would need to be able to
  continue forward. By installing a few extra packages from the BLFS
  book while still in our current chroot environment, you can leave
  yourself in a much better position to continue on once you reboot
  into your new LFS installation. Installing a text mode web browser,
  such as Lynx, you can easily view the BLFS book in one virtual terminal,
  while building packages in another. The GPM package will also allow you
  to perform copy/paste actions in your virtual terminals. Lastly, if you
  are in a situation where static IP configuration does not meet your
  networking requirements, installing packages such as Dhcpcd or PPP at
  this point might also be useful.</para>

  <para>Now that we have said that, lets move on to booting our shiny
  new LFS installation for the first time! First exit from the chroot
  environment:</para>

<screen><userinput>logout</userinput></screen>

  <para>Then unmount the virtual file systems:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/dev/pts
umount $LFS/dev/shm
umount $LFS/dev
umount $LFS/proc
umount $LFS/sys</userinput></screen>

  <para>Unmount the LFS file system itself:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>If multiple partitions were created, unmount the other
  partitions before unmounting the main one, like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/usr
umount $LFS/home
umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

  <para>Now, reboot the system with:</para>

<screen><userinput>shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

  <para>Assuming the boot loader was set up as outlined earlier,
  <emphasis>CLFS &version;</emphasis> will boot automatically.</para>

  <para>When the reboot is complete, the LFS system is ready for use and
  more software may be added to suit your needs.</para>
