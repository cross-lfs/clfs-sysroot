  <title>Foreword</title>

  <para>My adventures in Linux began in 1998 when I downloaded and
  installed my first distribution. After working with it for a while, I
  discovered issues I definitely would have liked to see improved upon.
  For example, I didn't like the arrangement of the bootscripts or the way
  programs were configured by default. I tried a number of alternative
  distributions to address these issues, yet each had its pros and cons.
  Finally, I realized that if I wanted full satisfaction from my Linux
  system, I would have to build my own from scratch.</para>

  <para>What does this mean? I resolved not to use pre-compiled packages
  of any kind, nor CD-ROMs or boot disks that would install basic
  utilities. I would use my current Linux system to develop my own
  customized system. This <quote>perfect</quote> Linux system would then
  have the strengths of various systems without their associated
  weaknesses. In the beginning, the idea was rather daunting, but I
  remained committed to the idea that a system could be built that would
  conform to my needs and desires rather than to a standard that just
  did not fit what I was looking for.</para>

  <para>After sorting through issues such as circular dependencies and
  compile-time errors, I created a custom-built Linux system that was
  fully operational and suitable to individual needs. This process also
  allowed me to create compact and streamlined Linux systems which are
  faster and take up less space than traditional operating systems. I
  called this system a Linux From Scratch system, or an LFS system for
  short.</para>

  <para>As I shared my goals and experiences with other members of the
  Linux community, it became apparent that there was sustained interest
  in the ideas set forth in my Linux adventures. Such custom-built LFS
  systems serve not only to meet user specifications and requirements, but
  also serve as an ideal learning opportunity for programmers and system
  administrators to enhance their Linux skills. Out of this broadened
  interest, the Linux From Scratch Project was born.</para>

  <para>This <emphasis>Linux From Scratch</emphasis> book provides
  readers with the background and instruction to design and build custom
  Linux systems. This book highlights the Linux from Scratch project and
  the benefits of using this system. Users can dictate all aspects of
  their system, including directory layout, script setup, and security.
  The resulting system will be compiled completely from the source code,
  and the user will be able to specify where, why, and how programs are
  installed. This book allows readers to fully customize Linux systems
  to their own needs and allows users more control over their
  system.</para>

  <para>I hope you will have a great time working on your own LFS
  system, and enjoy the numerous benefits of having a system that is
  truly <emphasis>your own</emphasis>.</para>
